# Practical Tips for using Generative AI in Data Science Workflows

This repository contains the slides for my keynote talk "Practical Tips for using Generative AI in Data Science Workflows", at posit::conf(2024) on August 13th, 2024, in Seattle.

**Please note:** This slide deck has around 230 slides, most of which just have pictures on them, so I used Google Slides rather than Quarto. To view the slides, they'll actually need to be downloaded (sorry!).
